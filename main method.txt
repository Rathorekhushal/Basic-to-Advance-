In Java, String[] args is a parameter in the main() method of a Java program. It stands for "command-line arguments" and is used to pass arguments to the Java program when it is executed from the command line
Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

String[]: This declares an array of strings. In Java, an array is a data structure that holds a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

args: This is the name of the array parameter. You can name it whatever you want, but args is a common convention and stands for "arguments".

When you run a Java program from the command line like this: 
java YourProgramName arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
 here is the program is given 


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print out each command-line argument
        for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Argument " + i + ": " + args[i]);
        }
    }
}
