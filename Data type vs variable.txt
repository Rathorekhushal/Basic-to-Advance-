Data Type:

A data type is a classification of data that specifies the type of value that a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on that value.
It defines the size, format, and allowable range of values for variables.
Data types in programming languages are used to represent different types of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.
Examples of data types include int, double, char, boolean, etc.
Data types are predefined in programming languages and determine the memory allocation and representation of data in computer memory.


Variable:

A variable is a named storage location in computer memory that can hold data.
It is used to store and manipulate values during the execution of a program.
Variables have a name, a data type, and a value.
The data type of a variable specifies the type of values that the variable can hold.
Variables are used to represent data in programs and can be assigned different values during program execution.
