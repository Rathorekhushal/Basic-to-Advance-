Methods overloading:
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,
 it is known as Method Overloading.

There are two ways to overload the method in java:
By changing number of arguments
By changing the data type
examples:
public class Studennt {
    // variables datamembers
    int studentId;
    String studentName;
    String studentCity;
    public Studennt(){
        System.out.println("this is the non-pramertries constructors");
    }
    // constructors overloaded
    public Studennt(int st1){
         System.out.println("this is perm constructors");
    }
    // behaviours of the datamembers 
    public void Study(){
        System.out.println(studentName +"is studying");
    }
    //here the method ovlerloading 
    public void Study(float f){
     System.out.println("here is the float value ");
    }
