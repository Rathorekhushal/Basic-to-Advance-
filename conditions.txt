conditions java 
In programming, conditions are statements or expressions that evaluate to either true or false.
 They are used to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on whether certain conditions are met or not.
 Conditions are fundamental to implementing logic
 and making programs more dynamic and responsive to different situations.
here it the code of coditions 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        // Example 1: if-else statement
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is positive");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is non-positive");
        }

        // Example 2: if-else if-else statement
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is positive");
        } else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is negative");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is zero");
        }

        // Example 3: Nested if statement
        int age = 20;
        boolean isStudent = true;
        if (age >= 18) {
            if (isStudent) {
                System.out.println("You are eligible for student discount");
            } else {
                System.out.println("You are eligible for regular ticket");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are too young to purchase a ticket");
        }
    }
}
