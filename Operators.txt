Operators:
In Java, operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Here's a list of some common operators in Java:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition: `+`
   - Subtraction: `-`
   - Multiplication: `*`
   - Division: `/`
   - Modulus (Remainder): `%`
   - Increment: `++`
   - Decrement: `--`

2. Relational Operators:
   - Equal to: `==`
   - Not equal to: `!=`
   - Greater than: `>`
   - Less than: `<`
   - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
   - Less than or equal to: `<=`

3. Logical Operators:
   - Logical AND: `&&`
   - Logical OR: `||`
   - Logical NOT: `!`

4. Assignment Operators:
   - Assignment: `=`
   - Addition assignment: `+=`
   - Subtraction assignment: `-=`
   - Multiplication assignment: `*=`
   - Division assignment: `/=`
   - Modulus assignment: `%=`

5. Bitwise Operators:
   - Bitwise AND: `&`
   - Bitwise OR: `|`
   - Bitwise XOR: `^`
   - Bitwise Complement: `~`
   - Left Shift: `<<`
   - Right Shift: `>>`
   - Unsigned Right Shift: `>>>`

6. Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator):
   - `? :`

7. Instanceof Operator:
   - `instanceof`

These are the basic operators in Java, and they are used extensively in programming to perform various tasks like mathematical computations, logical operations, assignment, etc.
