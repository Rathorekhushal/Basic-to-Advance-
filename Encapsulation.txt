Encapsulation:

Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
 for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
Example:
//A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.  
//It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.  
package com.javatpoint;  
public class Student{  
//private data member  
private String name;  
//getter method for name  
public String getName(){  
return name;  
}  
//setter method for name  
public void setName(String name){  
this.name=name  
}  
}
