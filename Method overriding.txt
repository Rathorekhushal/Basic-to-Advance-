Method overriding in java:

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class,
 it is known as method overriding in Java.
Example:

//Java Program to demonstrate why we need method overriding  
//Here, we are calling the method of parent class with child  
//class object.  
//Creating a parent class  
class Vehicle{  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike extends Vehicle{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  //creating an instance of child class  
  Bike obj = new Bike();  
  //calling the method with child class instance  
  obj.run();  
  }  
}
