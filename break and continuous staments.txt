continue statement:

The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code within a loop's body 
for the current iteration and proceed with the next iteration.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    System.out.println(i); // Prints odd numbers only
}
break statement:
The break statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement immediately.
When encountered, the break statement causes the control to exit the loop or
 switch statement and continue with the next statement after the loop or switch.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i reaches 5
    }
    System.out.println(i); // Prints numbers from 0 to 4
}
