Switch Statement in java 
In Java, the switch statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression. 
Here's the basic syntax:
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    // additional cases as needed
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
